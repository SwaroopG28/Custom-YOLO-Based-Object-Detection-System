# Custom YOLO-Based Object Detection System

## Project Overview
This project is focused on building a **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection system** from scratch using **Python** and **TensorFlow**. YOLO is a well-known real-time object detection model that processes images in a single pass, enabling fast and efficient multi-object recognition.

## Key Features
- Designed and implemented a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture for object detection.
- Integrated features like **anchor boxes**, **bounding box regression**, and **non-max suppression** to enhance model performance.
- Applied **data augmentation** techniques to improve the modelâ€™s robustness and ability to generalize to new data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV** for image processing and visualization.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a model capable of detecting and localizing multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and in real time.
